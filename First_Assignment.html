				<h3>Belief</h3>
				<p>&Tab; My belief is shaped by certain factors such as: <br>&Tab;1. The Association I belong to <br>&Tab; 2. The books I've read <br>&Tab; 3. The People I've related with and <br>&Tab; 4. The Environment I grew up or what is generally regarded as Background.<br><br>Highlights of my Believes...<br>1. I am theistic - Monotheism (I believe there is God; Just only *ONE* God).<br>2. I believe that Jesus Christ is the Only Son of God. He is the ONLY way to God, the only way to obtaining Salvation from Sin and Satan. Just as the Holy Scripture states &quot;Neither is there salvation in any other, nor is there a name given among men whereby we might be saved.&quot; &quot;No other foundation can be laid, except that which is laid which is Jesus Christ.&quot;<br> 3. I believe that Faith without work is Dead. <br> 4. I believe that you must inspect what you expect as often as possible.<br> Watch out for other beliefs I hold on update of this web page.</p>
